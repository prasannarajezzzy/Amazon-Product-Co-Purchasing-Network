# Google Colab Example: Sine Wave Plot

## Overview

This is a simple example code snippet to run on Google Colab, demonstrating how to generate and plot a sine wave using Python. The code is written in a Jupyter Notebook-like environment provided by Google Colab.

## Usage

1. **Open in Google Colab:**
   - Open Google Colab in your browser at [https://colab.research.google.com/](https://colab.research.google.com/).
   - Create a new notebook.
   - Copy and paste the code into a code cell.

2. **Run the Code:**
   - Run the cell by clicking on the play button next to the cell or using the keyboard shortcut Shift + Enter.

## Code Explanation

The provided code does the following:

- Installs the `matplotlib` library (if not already installed).
- Imports necessary libraries (`matplotlib` and `numpy`).
- Generates a set of data points for a sine wave.
- Plots the sine wave using Matplotlib.

## Dependencies

The code relies on the `matplotlib` and `numpy` libraries. If they are not already installed, the code includes a command to install them.

## Notes

- Ensure that you have an active internet connection to use Google Colab.
- Google Colab provides access to GPU and TPU resources, which can be leveraged for accelerated computations.

Feel free to modify and extend the code for your specific tasks.
