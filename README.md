# Amazon Product Co-Purchasing Network Project

## Introduction

Welcome to the Amazon Product Co-Purchasing Network project! This project aims to explore the vast dataset of the Amazon product co-purchasing network, gaining valuable insights into customer purchasing behaviors. The main objectives include understanding network structure, identifying frequently co-purchased products, and developing a robust product recommendation system.

## Project Overview

### Network Analysis

#### Network Structure and Complexity
- Analyze the growth in network size and edges to understand the expansion of products and relationships.

#### Average Clustering Coefficient
- Explore the local clustering tendency within the network and its increase with network size.

#### Connected Components
- Examine strongly and weakly connected components to assess network cohesion and global connectivity.

#### Centrality Analysis
- Identify top central nodes (products) and analyze their changes with network growth, providing insights into customer preferences.

### Overall Conclusions
- Summarize key findings, emphasizing local clustering and evolving customer behavior with network expansion.

## Future Work

### Data Preparation
- Clean and combine datasets from various sources (sales, reviews, products) to create a comprehensive training dataset.

### Model Training
- Implement artificial neural network models on the prepared dataset for generating product recommendations.

### Collaborative Filtering
- Enhance the recommendation system with collaborative filtering algorithms.

### Prediction and Comparison
- Generate recommendations and compare them with real-time Amazon website recommendations.

### Amazon Website Analysis
- Manually explore Amazon website recommendations and potentially develop a crawler for automated data retrieval.

### Evaluation and Insights
- Assess the accuracy of model-generated recommendations compared to real-time Amazon recommendations.
- Investigate additional data sources used by Amazon for recommendations.

## Conclusion

Recapitulate the project's objectives, key findings, and implications for targeted marketing and personalized product recommendations based on the co-purchasing network analysis.
